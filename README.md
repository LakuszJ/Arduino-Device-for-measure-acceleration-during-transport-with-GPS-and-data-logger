Arduino Device for Measuring Acceleration during Transport with GPS and Data Logger
This device can be attached to various objects, such as concrete elements, to measure the accelerations (forces) acting on them during transport. 
The device is specifically designed for measuring acceleration during transportation. Acceleration data is recorded alongside GPS location, speed, and other additional data.
Before initializing the data logging mode, calibration is performed to create a rotation matrix. This ensures accurate readings. 
Additionally, the device features a rotating board that allows for sensor leveling. Different colored LEDs indicate the level of accuracy.

Its main components include:
1) Arduino R4 Wifi
2) LSM6DSO Pololu 2798 Accelerometer
3) Adafruit 746 MTK3339 GPS
4) SparkFun GPS-00177 Antenna
5) Micro SD memory module
